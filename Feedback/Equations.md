Basic feedback loop model:

$$FL = ff/1-fb$$

where FL is the feedback loop, ff is the feedforward component, and fb is the feedback (recurrent) component. When fb > 1, the loop is unstable.

PID model:

$$p(t) = K_p + K_i + K_d$$

where $K_p$ is the proportional component, $K_i$ is the integral component, and $K_d$ is the derivative component, $$K_p/T_i$$ is integrated time, and $$K_p/T_d$$ is derivative time.
