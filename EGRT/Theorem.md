General approach to regulation from Sommerhoff (1950).

Ashby reformulates Z in set-theoretic terms.

### Variables
D = primary process that causes events in S and drives outcomes of G.

G = "good" events that are a subset of Z.

Z = total set of all events that can occur.

R = specific events represented in regulator.  

S = all possible events in regulator.  

### Questions (from Conant and Ashby, 1970):
How are R, S, and Z interrelated?  

Optimal regulators can be simple or complex.  

Search for best regulator is a search among mappings from S into R.
