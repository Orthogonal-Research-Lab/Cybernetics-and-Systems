## Notes:

Notes on a "good" regulator based on Conant and Ashby, 1970.



General approach to regulation from Sommerhoff (1950).

Ashby reformulates Z in set-theoretic terms.


D = primary process that causes events in S and drives outcomes of G.

G = "good" events that are a subset of Z.

Z = total set of all events that can occur.

R = specific events represented in regulator.

S = all possible events in regulator.


How are R, S, and Z interrelated?

Optimal regulators can be simple or complex.

Search for best regulator is a search among mappings from S into R.
