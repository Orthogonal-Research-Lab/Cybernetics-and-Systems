How to measure interacting components:  

Two vectors are strongly interactive if there is a high degree of cross-correlation (_c_ > 0.75).  

* probability density function of _M, N_ is the sum of the two vectors, convolution (_M_ * _N_) is the cross correlation of _m(t)_ and _n(-t)_.  

* interactivity can also be defined by a high degree of anti-correlation (_c_ < -0.75). Results in anti-phase behavior.   

* a covariance matrix can also define strong interactivity, for _cov(M,N)_ > 0.75.

* distance metric can also be used to define the potential for interactivity (shoter distances are more likely to interact).

* mutual information can also be used to define strong interactivity, for _I(M;N)_ --> _max I(M;N)_.



Equivalences but Asymmetry = Structure.

* no solution to inverse problem.

* emergent system not reversible, but has many equivalent sets of interactions.

* not just any old path to emergence, however.

* no exact solution, but structure!
