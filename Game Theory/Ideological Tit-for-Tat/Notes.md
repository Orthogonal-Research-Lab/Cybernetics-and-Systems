Ideological tit-for-tat combines the tit-for-tat game (iterated PD) with ideological game theory (IGT). 

In IGT, strategies can be played both rationally and ideologically.

* rational decision-making is weighted or obliterated by the ideological component, which is a series of beliefs about the world (as opposed to empirical observations).

* the idelogical component can be modeled as an internal model, or the ideological and empirical components can be modeled as a connectionist model (I/O system).
