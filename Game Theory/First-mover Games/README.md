Embryogenesis as a first-mover game. For example, see Figure 4 in Stone, R., Portegys, T., Mikhailovsky, G., and Alicea, B. (2018). [Origins of the Embryo: self-organization through cybernetic regulation](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/316861647_Origins_of_the_Embryo_self-organization_through_cybernetic_regulation_Preprint). _BioSystems_, 173, 73-82.

Tic-tac-toe (noughts and crosses)  [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe)  

* tic-tac-toe is both an example of a first-mover advantage and a futile game.

* tic-tac-toe also provides us with a good model of [game complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_complexity), which allows us to link first-mover dynamics with complexity and biological model abstractions.
