Embryogenesis as a first-mover game. For example, see Figure 4 in Stone, R., Portegys, T., Mikhailovsky, G., and Alicea, B. (2018). [Origins of the Embryo: self-organization through cybernetic regulation](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/316861647_Origins_of_the_Embryo_self-organization_through_cybernetic_regulation_Preprint). _BioSystems_, 173, 73-82.

Stackleberg games (general case) and equilibria [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stackelberg_competition#targetText=In%20game%20theory%20terms%2C%20the,sustaining%20of%20a%20Stackelberg%20equilibrium.)

* first-mover advantage. Useful for competing processes, cell lineages, or populations. 

Tic-tac-toe (naughts and crosses)  [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe)  

* tic-tac-toe is both an example of a first-mover advantage and a futile game (see [futile cycles](https://github.com/Orthogonal-Research-Lab/Cybernetics-and-Systems/tree/master/Game%20Theory/Futile%20Cycle)).

* tic-tac-toe also provides us with a good model of [game complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_complexity), which allows us to link first-mover dynamics with complexity and biological model abstractions.
