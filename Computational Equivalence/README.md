Computational Equivalence:

Implemental and eliminative connectionism (Fodor and Pylyshyn, 1988).

* eliminative: subsymbolic, information stored in wieghts (statistical).

* brain = symbolic processor, discover machinery needed for symbolic processing.

* the brain (or other complex systems) can compute the same things as a computer (or for 
computers to emulate natural systems). Chapter 12 in NKS.

Hypothalamus, thermostat autonomic control (models for autonomic control).

* Morrison, Thermostat concept. Temperature, 2(3), 332-333 (2015).

Computational equivalence:

* underlying structures show a certain kind of equivalence.

* rules can be found that achieve universality.

* universal computation (Turing machines, cellular automata), natural systems can never carry out a computation more complex than this.

* mathematical models can introduce too much computational sphistication (natural system performs computations more simply).

* if behavior of a system is obviously simple (e.g. repetitive, nested), then it will be computationally reducible.

* formulas require reducibility, but most problems are irreducible (requires some computational work to solve).

Multiway systems (substitution systems):

* computational principles for such systems.

* computationally irreducible?

* Turing machines -- systems based on ?

New Kind of Science: instead of mathematical models, are there computational systems that can characterize a computational POV?

* systems with quite different underlying structures show a certain kind of equivalence.

Language, Icons, Symbols constructed by:

* perceptual iconicity (geometric isomorphism).

* proportional fittingness (algebraic isomorphism).

Isomorphism:

* when mappings between A and B are linear and reversible.

Memory without record (first proposed by von Forester):

* thermostat (remembers temperature, operates at this temperature).

* computes "difference" between memory (setting) and temperature of surrounding space.

>>>>> also analogous to difference between current experience (or view) and conditions of larger context.

* similar to homeostat concept of Weiner.

Math problems --> do you remember every answer (flash cards), or do you remeber the operations (operator's rules) and then reproduce answer for a wide range of problems?

* while the brain is more complicated than a thermostat, they are similar (not computationally equivalent) to thermostats.

* brain can produce much more complex computations than a thermostat. But is a homeostat (artificial organism with brain-like components) equivalent to the brain?

* set points ~ computational procedures (procedural knowledge).
