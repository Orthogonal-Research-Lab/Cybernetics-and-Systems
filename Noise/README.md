Noise has three role to play in complex systems:

Noise as interference (signal vs. noise).

Noise as assistance (stochastic resonance). See [Amplification repo](https://github.com/Orthogonal-Research-Lab/Cybernetics-and-Systems/tree/master/Amplification) for more information.

Noise as variational component (way to introduce diversity).
