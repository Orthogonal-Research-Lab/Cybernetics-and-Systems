Rosenbluth, A., Weiner, N., and Bigelow, J. (1943). Behavior, Purpose, and Teleology. _Philosophy of Science_, 10(1), 18-24.

Teleology = purpose controlled by feedback (temporal feedback).

* scope + flexibility (temporal multiplication of effects).

Spatial multiplication is abundant in nature, while temporal multiplication is poor (e.g. nerve conduction is slow compared to fibre optic cable).

* scanning is a temporal sampling strategy missing in nature (e.g. television set versus visual system).

* undampened feedback -- Cerebellar or motor control disorder.

* teleology <--> causality, time (t) is the x-axis.
