Teleology = purpose controlled by feedback (temporal feedback).

* scope + flexibility (temporal multiplication of effects).

Spatial multiplication is abundant in nature, while temporal multiplication is poor (e.g. nerve conduction is slow compared to fibre optic cable).

* scanning is a temporal sampling strategy missing in nature (e.g. television set versus visual system).

* undampened feedback -- Cerebellar or motor control disorder.

* teleology <--> causality, time (t) is the x-axis.

* is the ordering of perceptual time absolute? 

* differences in perceptual sampling and metabolic rate are characterized between species in terms of allometric scaling. Is there a rival relativistic model that could answer related questions?

* does time flow faster in insects than it does in humans? Is this difference in sampling rate connected to relativistic phenomena?
